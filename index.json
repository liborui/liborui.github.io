To be more spe- cific, LinkLab 2.0 leverages a tiered architecture for the pro- grammable devices and the management system to achieve scalability. To better support the integrated experiment among IoT, edge and cloud, LinkLab 2.0 provides one-site pro- gramming support and leverages the customizable offloading with serverless functions. Moreover, LinkLab 2.0 proposes a device-involved multi-tenancy approach to ensure respon- siveness for concurrent requests. Furthermore, targeting 24/7 availability for experimenters, LinkLab 2.0 leverages proac- tive and reactive anomaly detection to improve the reliability of the testbed. Finally, we describe the supported research experiments and the outreach usage by external users. We also report lessons learned from the four-year operation. Lin- kLab 2.0 has supported experiments for 2,100+ users. The accumulated usage time across all the devices exceeds 17,300 hours.","tags":["selected"],"title":"LinkLab 2.0: A Multi-tenant Programmable IoT Testbed for Experimentation with Edge-Cloud Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Borui Li","Wei Dong","Yi Gao","Yanwei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"2079612c3aff19dcdefe229d137642d1","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/publication/15-cccf22-low-code/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/15-cccf22-low-code/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"物联网软件低代码开发","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653004800,"objectID":"01dd85010ca9f6d1230ed136253681ee","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/news/20220520-mobisys22-accept/","publishdate":"2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20220520-mobisys22-accept/","section":"news","summary":"","tags":null,"title":":smiley: Our paper named \u003cfont color=#FF0000 \u003e**Bringing WebAssembly to Resource-constrained IoT Devices for Seamless Device-Cloud Integration**\u003c/font\u003e is accepted to [**ACM MobiSys 2022**](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2022/) !

Taking the metaprogram as an input, AutoLink automatically transforms it into corresponding optimization problems and generates the optimal hardware conﬁguration that meets user requirements best. Towards this, AutoLink also offers a cross-platform, dutycycle-aware power model and a time model to estimate the lifetime and execution period of an IoT system.

A typical IoT application usually consists of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and the client side. The development of a complete IoT application is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves drastically different technologies and complex interactions between different sides.\nUnlike traditional IoT development platforms which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual sensor mechanism which helps developers express application logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices.\nWe implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while still achieving high expressiveness.\n","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"34869ee06f7feb45e04ec144633689e6","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/project/tinylink2.0/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tinylink2.0/","section":"project","summary":"Integrating Device, Cloud, and Client Development for IoT Applications.","tags":["TinyLink","Rapid Development","IoT"],"title":"TinyLink 2.0","type":"project"},{"authors":["Borui Li","Wei Dong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585440000,"objectID":"1b4ea4a0c0f514fae795b09c83a60d69","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/publication/2-icdcs20-edgeprog/","publishdate":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2-icdcs20-edgeprog/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["selected"],"title":"EdgeProg: Edge-centric Programming for IoT Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"😃 Our paper named “EdgeProg: Edge-centric Programming for IoT Applications” is accepted to IEEE ICDCS 2020 !\n","date":1584921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584921600,"objectID":"f8260b575bcf37139f8f4876ee823b1f","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/news/20200323-icdcs20-accept/","publishdate":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20200323-icdcs20-accept/","section":"news","summary":"😃 Our paper named “EdgeProg: Edge-centric Programming for IoT Applications” is accepted to IEEE ICDCS 2020 !","tags":null,"title":":smiley: Our paper named [EdgeProg: Edge-centric Programming for IoT Applications](/publication/2020-icdcs20-edgeprog) is accepted to **IEEE ICDCS 2020!**","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"😃 Our paper named TinyLink 2.0: Integrating Device, Cloud, and Client Development for IoT Applications is accepted by MobiCom\u0026#39;20\n","date":1581292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581292800,"objectID":"e859a74b7a3e3d4a702c75ab3b1ca841","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/news/20200210-tinylink2-accept/","publishdate":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/20200210-tinylink2-accept/","section":"news","summary":"😃 Our paper named TinyLink 2.","tags":null,"title":":smiley: Our paper named [TinyLink 2.0: Integrating Device, Cloud, and Client Development for IoT Applications](/publication/2020-mobicom20-tinylink2) is accepted by **ACM MobiCom 2020!**","type":"news"},{"authors":["Gaoyang Guan","Borui Li","Yi Gao","Yuxuan Zhang","Jiajun Bu","Wei Dong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576886400,"objectID":"d375e835f2a45095c1e32dbee9b828f3","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/publication/1-mobicom20-tinylink2/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1-mobicom20-tinylink2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["selected"],"title":"TinyLink 2.0: Integrating Device, Cloud, and Client Development for IoT Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"LinkLab (Home Page) is a testbed for remotely developing and experimenting IoT applications.

Developers write the application code in a C-like language to specify the key logic of their applications, without dealing with the details of the specific hardware components. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardware configuration as well as the binary program executable on the target hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs for applications to interact with the underlying hardware components.\nWe implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using realworld IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achieves rapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of lines of code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2) TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generate a superior solution for the hardware configuration, compared with the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptable overhead in terms of execution time and program memory.\n","date":1493251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493251200,"objectID":"7d35f0f7d39e9a5921e56ab7fc5ee55a","permalink":"https://www.liborui.cn/project/tinylink/","publishdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tinylink/","section":"project","summary":"A Holistic System for Rapid Development of IoT Applications.","tags":["TinyLink","Rapid Development","IoT"],"title":"TinyLink","type":"project"}]
